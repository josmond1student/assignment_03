# Assignement 3 - CEN 2361
I am a student as State College of Florida (SCF). This semester I'm taking the class CEN 2361 - Mobile Web Apps.

This is my project for our assignment in Chapter 3. This is a mobile web app that uses JSON to find rhyming words for a word entered into the app.

Please visit https://josmond1student.github.io/assignment_03/ to run and intstall the app.
